# Point of Sale System (Retail)
### This is a Point of Sales system I wrote tailored to the retail market that covers a wide array of feutures.
### I wrote the system in C# (WPF) and Microsoft SQL Server with a strong data driven approach.

For a basic overview of the system please refer the [POS Basic Overview] document in [POSSystem/POS Basic Overview.docx]

Check out this video for a demonstration of the POS: YT LINK

### Scripts and Backups
* All T-SQL Tables, Views, Procedures and Functions in [POSSystem/SQL/]
* Complete T-SQL Schema create script in [POSSystem/Create Database Schema.sql]
* Database backup with some of my own dummy data in [POSSystem/POSSystem.bak]

### Some of the Features include:
* Company Setup: Configure basic information about the company to be used in the POS system.
* Terminal Setup: Define and customize terminal settings for different points of sale.
* User Setup: Manage user accounts and their roles within the system.
* History Logging: Keep track of all activities within the system for auditing and accountability.
* Item Groups: Categorize items into groups for better organization and reporting.
* Items: Manage and track individual items in the inventory.
* Graphs: Visualize sales data through graphical representations for better insights.
* Cashier Setup: Set up and manage cashier accounts for handling transactions.
* Shifts for Cashiers: Track and manage cashier shifts for operational efficiency.
* Cash Up After Shift: Perform cash reconciliation at the end of each cashier's shift.
* Sales History: Access comprehensive sales history for analysis and reporting.
* Stock Receiving: Manage the intake of new stock into the inventory.
* Stock Count: Conduct regular stock counts to maintain accurate inventory levels.
* System Security: Ensure the security of the POS system through role-based access controls.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A FULLY FUNCTIONAL POINT OF SALE SYSTEM READY FOR PRODUCTION. THIS IS A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT ILLUSTRATING ALL THE FEATURES A POS SYSTEM WOULD INTAIL AND HOW IT CAN BE USED IN A CUSTOMIZABLE ENVIORMENT. CERTAIN FEATURES ARE NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL.
